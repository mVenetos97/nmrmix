"""
NMR Deconvolution and Anlysis module for Python
====================================================

nmrmix is an basic NMR analysis package, capable of
determining the composition of a reaction mixture as
well as determine the correct NMR parameters of the
constituent molecules.


It aims to provide simple and efficient solution to
a bottleneck in high-throughput experimentation and
allows one to bypass any purification steps and move
directly towards spectral analysis. This workflow does
not require any existing library of known spectra and
can instead work using a set of DFT-calculated, or
machine learning-predicted NMR spectra.
